## 📖 About this Module

This folder contains **fundamental C++ programs** for learning programming concepts with security in mind.  
Scripts cover variables, control flow, functions, arrays/vectors, file I/O, hashing, and exception handling.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Compile a C++ file:
```bash
g++ VariablesAndOperators.cpp -o VariablesAndOperators
```

### 2. Run it:
```bash
./VariablesAndOperators
```

---

## 🛠 Tools Required

- **Compiler:** g++ (or any C++17 compatible compiler)  
- **Editor/IDE:** CLion, VSCode, Code::Blocks, or any terminal-based editor  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Understand basic C++ syntax and operators  
- Use control structures: if-else, switch, for/while loops  
- Write and call functions with parameters  
- Work with arrays and vectors  
- Perform file input/output  
- Implement hashing for security tasks (requires OpenSSL)  
- Handle exceptions and write safer code  

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Always test code in a safe environment  
- Try modifying the scripts to experiment with different cases  
- Follow good practices for security (e.g., never hardcode secrets)
